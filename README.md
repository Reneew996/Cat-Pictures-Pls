# Cat-Pictures-Pls
Visual Communication Design Major Project
A interactive web comic developed for my fourth year major project. The comic is adapted from the short story 'Cat Pictures Please' by Naomi Kritzer, used with her permission. 
All illustrations and photos were created by me. 
May contain minor flashing imagery.
